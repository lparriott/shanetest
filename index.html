<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>Westhart Deer Meats began with two lifelong friends, Trey Stutheit and Shane Westhart, who grew up hunting together and learning the value of processing their own game. What started as a shared love for the outdoors quickly turned into a passion for helping other hunters gain the same skills and confidence. They noticed that many young hunters wanted to process their own deer but did not always have the knowledge, tools, or affordable options to get started. That is where Westhart Deer Meats comes in. Built on a foundation of hard work, hands-on learning, and a deep respect for hunting traditions, the goal is to make deer processing both affordable and accessible for everyone. The company offers professional deer processing services for hunters who want quality cuts done right, and for those eager to learn the craft themselves, it sells DIY Deer Processing Kits complete with tools, guides, and resources. To make learning even easier, there are step-by-step videos showing exactly how to process your own deer from start to finish. At Westhart Deer Meats, it is more than just a business. It is a community of hunters who believe in doing things the right way, keeping traditions alive, and helping others build confidence through experience. Westhart Deer Meats makes the process simple, affordable, and rewarding.</p>
